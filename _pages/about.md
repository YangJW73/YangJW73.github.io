I am currently the head of Intelligent NPC team in Tencent Inc. 

In the past few years, I've been dedicated to exploring building intelligent game agents with the help of AI technology, such as RL-based AI agents and LLM-based AI agents for various types of games. 

I'm also the main author of "Core Algorithms of Reinforcement Learning and Its applications"ï¼Œand the co-author of "Tencent Game Development Essentials II".
