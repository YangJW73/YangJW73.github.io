I am currently the head of Intelligent NPC team at Tencent Inc.

In the past few years, I've been dedicated to exploring building intelligent game agents with the help of AI technology, such as **RL-based AI agents** and **LLM-based AI agents** for various types of games.

I'm the main author of *"Core Algorithms of Reinforcement Learning and Its Applications"*, and the co-author of *"Tencent Game Development Essentials II"*.

My research interests include:
- **Reinforcement Learning** and its applications in games
- **LLM-based Agents** for interactive environments
- **Game AI** and intelligent NPC design
