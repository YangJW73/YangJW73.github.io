    Artificial Intelligence is the elucidation of human learning process, the quantification of human thinking process, the explication of human behavior, and the understanding of what makes intelligence possible. It is men's final step to understand themselves, and I hope to take part in this new, but most promising science.

I'm a **Principal Researcher (T12 Expert)** and currently **the Head of the Intelligent NPC Team** and **the Large Language Model Team** in the AI Engine Department at <a href='https://www.tencent.com'>Tencent Inc.</a>.

I'm also the main author of *"Core Algorithms of Reinforcement Learning and Its Applications"*, and the co-author of *"Tencent Game Development Essentials II"*.

In the past few years, I've been dedicated to exploring building intelligent agents using advanced AI technologies, including **Reinforcement Learning (RL) Algorithms, Large Language Models (LLM), Supervised Learning Algorithms** and other related technologies. These agents, which are already deployed in various types of commercial games, show great capabilities in areas such as driving, combat, collaboration, and adversarial scenarios.



My current research interests include:
- **Reinforcement Learning** and its applications in games
- **LLM-based Agents** for interactive environments
- **Game AI** and intelligent NPC design
- **Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)** or general decision making models
