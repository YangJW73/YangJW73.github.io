    Artificial Intelligence is the elucidation of human learning process, the quantification of human thinking process, the explication of human behavior, and the understanding of what makes intelligence possible. It is men's final step to understand themselves, and I hope to take part in this new, but most promising science.

I am a **Principal Researcher (T12 Expert)** and currently **the head of the Intelligent NPC team** and **the Large Language Model Team** in the AI Engine Department at <a href='https://www.tencent.com'>Tencent Inc.</a>.

In the past few years, I've been dedicated to exploring building intelligent game agents with the help of AI technology, such as **RL-based AI agents** and **LLM-based AI agents** for various types of games.

I'm the main author of *"Core Algorithms of Reinforcement Learning and Its Applications"*, and the co-author of *"Tencent Game Development Essentials II"*.

My current research interests include:
- **Reinforcement Learning** and its applications in games
- **LLM-based Agents** for interactive environments
- **Game AI** and intelligent NPC design
